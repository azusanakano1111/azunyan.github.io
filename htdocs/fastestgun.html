	<h1 style= "font-family: Verdana";>Synopsis</h1>
	<p style= "font-family: Verdana; text-align: justify";>By the year 1899, the age of outlaws and gunslingers was at an end. America was becoming a land of laws. Even the West had mostly been tamed. During this time, the (L/N)s, a notorious family of outlaws wanted in all 45 states of the United States of America (Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Hawaii and Alaska didn't join the Union yet), fled to the East. After stowing away on a ship to Japan and making landfall, the family found themselves in Japan. During this time, the mother, (M/N) (L/N), had gotten pregnant with their unborn child. They decided to build a house for themselves in the mountains, away from local law enforcement. There, they befriended a neighboring family known as the Kamado.</p>
	<br>
	<p style= "font-family: Verdana; text-align: justify";>Five years later, the (L/N)s decided to move in order to find a permanent and more comfortable home for themselves and their son (Y/N). After finding a nice patch of land in a remote area away from civilization, they decided to live there. But on a tragic night, while a five year old (Y/N) was hunting with his dad, they heard a familiar blood-curling scream. Rushing home, they found the inside of the house ransacked. But the worst thing they found was the mangled and mutilated corpse of (Y/N)'s mother.</p>

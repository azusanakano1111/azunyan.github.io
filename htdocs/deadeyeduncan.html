	<h1 style= "font-family: Verdana";>Synopsis</h1>
	<p style= "font-family: Verdana; text-align: justify";>The Golden Age of Piracy gave birth to numerous legendary pirates. Familiar names such as Blackbeard, Captain Kidd, Calico Jack, Charles Vane, Anne Bonny, Mary Read, Stede Bonnet and Black Bart should come to mind. But there are two other pirates whose names are lost to history. Well, at least to people who aren't Assassins or Templars.</p>
	<br>
	<p style= "font-family: Verdana; text-align: justify";>Duncan Frye was born with a gift. A sixth sense capable of seeing things that ordinary people can't. This gift improved his accuracy with a flintlock, garnering him the nickname of "Deadeye Duncan." He used these skills in order to become a bounty hunter. His next target was a man also named Duncan, but with a different surname. While tracking the man down, he found himself shipwrecked on a remote island with two other men. And lo and behold, one of them was Duncan Walpole. And the other? A pirate by the name of Kenway.</p>

				<h3 style= "font-family: Verdana";>Duncan Frye</h3>
				<p style= "font-family: Verdana; text-align: justify";>Duncan Frye is a bounty hunter and pirate known for his accuracy with a gun. His deadeye precision gave him the nickname "Deadeye Duncan," a name which would soon be feared all over the Carribean by not just pirates, but the Assassins and Templars as well. He was stranded on Cape Bonavista after a three-way naval battle against his target, Duncan Walpole and the pirate, Edward Kenway. <a href= "https://www.pinterest.ph/pin/542543086331318870/" style= "text-decoration: none; color: yellow";><span style= "color: yellow; font-style: italic";>Image Source.</span></a></p>
